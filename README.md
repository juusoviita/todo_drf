# todo_drf

Todo app built using Django Rest Framework and React. The user can:
- add a new task,
- edit an existing task,
- delete a task,
- mark task as completed,
- toggle a reminder on a task, and
-  hide/show completed tasks.

Based on the Dennis Ivy video series and TraversyMedia's React Crash Course on YouTube, among other sources:

Potential development ideas to implement:

- add user to the Models, user registerstration, log in, and log out functionality
- drag and drop to reorder tasks,
- change background using Unsplash API? (current background is default)
